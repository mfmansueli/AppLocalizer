# AppLocalizer

macOS app (SwiftUI, macOS 27+) for localizing apps faster through the App Store Connect API:

- **Subscription pricing:** per-territory prices for every subscription, from one base price.
- **Store page:** the App Store listing's text in every locale.
- **AI assistants (optional):** a local MCP server lets Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor or Codex read the
  listing and propose text. Proposals wait in Review & Push like any other change; assistants can't push.

It works with a team API key. The design brief for the full feature set is in `DESIGN_PROMPT.md`.

## Connecting an API key

1. In App Store Connect, open **Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API → Team Keys**.
2. Generate a key with the **Admin** or **App Manager** role. Prices and metadata can't be edited with less.
3. In the app, enter the **Issuer ID** and **Key ID**, then drop in the downloaded `AuthKey_<KEYID>.p8`. The Key ID fills itself in from the file name.

"Connect" signs one `GET /v1/apps?limit=1` before saving anything. The key is stored as one generic-password item in the login Keychain (`KeychainCredentialsStore`). Every request carries a freshly signed ES256 JWT (`AppStoreConnectJWT`), so the `.p8` itself never leaves the Mac. Remove the key in Settings → Account.

## Architecture

It follows Bruma's patterns (`~/Projects/ios/Bruma`).

- **Folders:**
  - `SupportFiles/`: the app entry point and assets.
  - `Managers/`: shared services: the App Store Connect client, the credentials store and `AppSession`.
  - `Models/`: shared models.
  - `Screens/<Feature>/`: the view and view model, plus `Model/` (pure logic and the services protocol), `Services/` (live implementations) and `Components/`.
  - `DesignSystem/`: tokens (`Palette`) and shared components.
  - `Debug/`: DEBUG-only scenes and fakes.
- `MCPBridge/`: the `applocalizer-mcp` command-line tool (see [AI assistants](#ai-assistants-mcp)). `Sources/` is
  compiled into the tool and the unit tests, and `Tool/main.swift` only into the tool.
- **One top-level type per file.** Extensions go in `Type+Topic.swift`.
- **State:** `@MainActor @Observable final class` view models with `private(set)` state.
  - Each feature talks to the outside world through a `@MainActor protocol <Feature>Services` with a `Live…` implementation. Tests and DEBUG scenes swap in fakes.
  - Views have two inits: a live one, and `init(viewModel:)` for previews and DEBUG scenes.
- **API client:** `AppStoreConnectClient` builds URLs, signs requests, maps HTTP errors (`AppStoreConnectError`) and follows `links.next` pagination. Each resource's endpoints go in their own extension, e.g. `AppStoreConnectClient+Apps.swift`. Requests go through `HTTPTransport`, so unit tests never reach Apple.
- **Swift 6** language mode, strict concurrency, nonisolated by default (like Bruma).

### DEBUG scenes

In a Debug build, launch with `-AppLocalizerDebugScene <id>` to open one state with canned data. A scene never contacts
App Store Connect or the Keychain, and the MCP server in a scene never opens a port. Each area keeps its ids in its own
`*DebugScenes` type, and `Debug/DebugSceneView.swift` routes them:

- **Library and overview:** `apps`, `apps-empty`, `apps-error`, `lib-loading`, `overview`, `overview-keep`.
- **Connect:** `connect`, `connect-key`, `connect-checking`, `connect-401`, `connect-403`, `connect-rejected`,
  `connect-offline`, `sync`, and more (`ConnectDebugScenes`).
- **Settings:** `set-account`, `set-pricing`, `set-translation`, `set-general`.
- **AI Assistants settings:** `set-ai-off`, `set-ai-pair`, `set-ai-waiting`, `set-ai-on`, `set-ai-connected`,
  `set-ai-disc`, `set-ai-log`.
- **Assistants at work:** `ai-translate`, `ai-streaming`, `ai-review`, `ai-conflict`, `overview-ai`.
- **Review & Push:** `review`, `review-assistant`, `push-progress`, `push-partial`, `push-conflict`, `activity`, the
  `banner-*` scenes, and more (`ReviewPushDebugScenes`).
- **Pricing** (`PricingDebugScenes`) and **Store Page** (`StorePageDebugScenes`): one scene per design screenshot.

The UI tests run through these scenes.

## AI assistants (MCP)

Settings → AI Assistants turns on a Streamable HTTP MCP server at `http://127.0.0.1:47321/mcp`. It's off by default,
only accepts connections from this Mac, and runs only while the app is open (`Managers/MCP/`).

- **Pairing:** each assistant gets its own bearer token from the "Pair an assistant" sheet, stored in the Keychain.
  Revoking it in Settings ends its sessions.
- **Tools:** `list_apps`, `get_listing`, `list_missing_translations` and `propose_listing_text`.
  - Every proposal is validated like a manual edit (limits, URLs, read-only versions), then queued as a change tagged
    with the assistant's name.
  - When a person already changed the same field, both versions are kept and Review & Push asks which to push.
  - Settings decides what assistants may propose, and the log says why a call was refused.
- **Prompts:** `translate_missing` and `whats_new_from_git`. A prompt is offered only while its tools are.
- **Clients:**
  - Claude Code and Cursor connect over HTTP.
  - Claude Desktop and Codex launch servers as processes, so they run the bundled bridge,
    `AppLocalizer.app/Contents/MacOS/applocalizer-mcp --token <token>`. It forwards stdio to the HTTP endpoint and
    starts a new session on its own when the app relaunches.

## Tests

- **Unit tests:** `AppLocalizerTests`, written with Swift Testing. They cover:
  - JWT signing and verification;
  - the client's requests, pagination and errors;
  - credentials validation;
  - the Keychain round trip, under a throwaway service name;
  - the session and the view models;
  - the MCP server (HTTP parsing, JSON-RPC, pairing, sessions, tools and prompts) and the stdio bridge.
- **UI tests:** `AppLocalizerUITests`, written with XCUITest, run against the DEBUG scenes.

Run everything with `xcodebuild -scheme AppLocalizer -destination 'platform=macOS' test`.

## Lint & formatting

The project is kept warning-free.

- Install the tools once: `brew install swiftlint swiftformat`.
- The `AppLocalizer` target's **Lint** build phase runs `swiftformat --lint` and `swiftlint lint` on every local build.
  - Findings show up as Xcode warnings.
  - The phase is skipped on Xcode Cloud, where the tools aren't installed.
- Format everything with `swiftformat .` from the repo root. `MCPBridge/` is linted too. The configs are `.swiftformat` and `.swiftlint.yml`, the same rules as Bruma.

### Build settings worth knowing

- `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING = NO` on the `AppLocalizer` target lets the Lint phase read the sources.
- The App Sandbox is on, with three exceptions:
  - outgoing connections (`ENABLE_OUTGOING_NETWORK_CONNECTIONS`), for the API;
  - incoming connections (`ENABLE_INCOMING_NETWORK_CONNECTIONS`), for the local MCP server;
  - user-selected files, read-only (`ENABLE_USER_SELECTED_FILES`), to import the `.p8`.
- The `applocalizer-mcp` target is sandboxed on its own, with outgoing connections only, because assistants launch it
  without the app.
  - `CREATE_INFOPLIST_SECTION_IN_BINARY` embeds the Info.plist that a sandboxed tool needs.
  - The app's **Embed Command Line Tool** phase copies the tool into `Contents/MacOS` and signs it.
- `LM_SKIP_METADATA_EXTRACTION = YES` (project level) silences Xcode's "Metadata extraction skipped, no AppIntents.framework dependency found" warning. **Remove it if the app ever adopts App Intents.**
